# ONLINE_BOOKSHOP_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The proposed project aims to create a student friendly online bookshop named "Online  Bookshop Management System." Online Bookshop Management System will provide an intuitive and interactive platform for students to explore and purchase various types of books, including PDFs, new hard copies, old books, and newsprints or whiteprints. The system will incorporate features such as book search by author, publication name, category, book name, and ISBN. Additionally, it will offer real-time information on book availability, order placement with user data, and flexible payment and delivery options.
